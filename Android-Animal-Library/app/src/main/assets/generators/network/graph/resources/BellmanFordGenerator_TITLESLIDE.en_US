	The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is used to determine all shortest paths from
	an arbitrary but fixed start node in a graph.

	[h2]The Algorithm[/h2]
	Unlike Dikstra's algorithm the algorithm of Bellman and Ford can also be 
	used on graphs with negative edges. The method detects a negative cycle[br]
	within the graph and returns the information that no path starting from the 
	selected node could be found.[br] 
	During each loop the Bellman-Ford algorithm searches for the shortest path 
	to all nodes in the graph. It adds each reachable node to the existing path[br]
	and checks if a new shorter path is created.[br]
	Each shortest path contains at most |V| âˆ’ 1 edges the search for a shorter path 
	is run that often. The complexity of the algorithm contains of the search for[br]
	the shortest path and the check for negative weighted cycles and is therefore
	O(|V | x |E|).[br]
