Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning [br]
over transactional databases. [br][br]

It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to [br]
larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. [br]
The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which [br]
highlight general trends in the database. The latter part is not included in this visualization. [br][br]

Apriori has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.
