The topological sorting is used to create an order [br]
of tasks such that dependencies between their execution[br]
are respected[br][br]

For that, each task is represented as a node in a directed[br]
graph. An arc between node a and b means that task b can[br]
be executed as soon as a has been executed.[br][br]

The following algorithm uses an iterative approach.
