Given a database table consisting of n rows and m attributes.
The task is to find the top k objects based on a score value. Can this be accomplished without analyzing all n rows?
To explain the algorithm, we will start with an example: 
We have a list of objects, which have attributes redness, roundness and area. For every attribute we 
have an associative array in decreasing order of the values of these objects.
The challenge is to find the top k objects with the highest score. 
The score is computed by a previously chosen function over all the attribute values. 
For example, the score can be the sum of all attribute values.
A simple algorithm would have to access every object and each attribute. The presented algorithm shows 
a way to solve this challenge in a more efficient way and only needs n' < n accesses.
