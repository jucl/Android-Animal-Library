As can be seen from the previous view, a total of k={0} top elements was found in the relation.[br]
For this aggregate, only {1} out of {2} rows of the table had to be analysed[br]
resulting in a reduced time complexity especially for big tables with hundreds of rows.[br]
One can see that since of the total of {4} elements from the associative maps on the upper right[br]
only {3} had to be analysed.
