The lower right matrix shows all attributes values seen so far.
For every missing attribute value in the upper right matrix we 
will perform a random access using the associative array. The 
random access differs from the parallel access because the 
parallel access reads all the attribute values from table row
at once whereas the random access reads single attribute values 
directly (e.g. via a hashtable). In the end, every attribute of the 
objects already seen has a value assigned to it.
