Interpolative Search is a very efficient algorithm for locating a given
element in an array of sorted elements.

The algorithm always regards only a certain partition of the array.
The first partition covers the complete array. The partition is
achieved in each iteration by selecting a 'current' element.
If this current element is less or greater than the value to look for,
the algorithm will only appropriate partition to the element's left 
or right, respectively.
If the value is found, its position is returned; otherwise, 
the algorithm with return -1 as an 'error mark'.

Pseudo code:

Test if the array exists, has a valid length, and lower bound l < upper bound r.
Interpolate a likely position 'mid' for the element in the full array.
If value == array[mid]:
  return mid;
If value < array[mid]:
  return search(array, value, l, mid - 1);
Otherwise:
  return search(array, value, mid + 1, r);

In the following animation, the current partition will be highlighted.
