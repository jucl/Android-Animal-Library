Simple Ray Tracing: a short introduction
}
{1
\t \t Raytracing is a technique used in computer graphics, to generate a usually 2-dimensional image from 3-dimensional objects in a virtual space.
\t \t In order to get a picture on a computer screen, this algorithm calculates the color of each pixel 
\t \t by virtually tracing the path of light through the pixels and then simulating light effects, 
\t \t like shadow or reflection, on the encounter with objects.
}
{2
\t \t To explain the basic concept of the algorithm, it is simplified by creating only 1-dimensional image from a 2-dimensional scene, 
\t \t and the only light effect used will be the determination, if an object is located in the shadow of another, depending on the light source.
}
{3
\t \t There is a camera, representing the perspective on the scene, a screen with several pixels in front of it, 
\t \t a light source like the sun or a lamp and several simple geometric objects.
}
{4
\t \t Knowing how to calculate an intersection point between a ray and a line (and therefore with any 2D object consisting of lines) 
\t \t is presumed in this example.
