{pixiterate
The algorithm now iterates over all pixels.
}
{createrays
A ray is created from the origin of the camera through pixel i.
}
{findintersections
The algorithm iterates now over all objects in the space and calculates all intersections with it. 
The closest intersection point to the camera will be selected. 
}
{color1
The pixel i will be colored with the same color of the intersecting object.
}
{shadow
A line is created from the origin of the intersection point to the light source.
}
{shadowcontinue
If there is an intersection with this line and any object in the scene,
the pixel will be darkened, because the object is located in the shadow of another or of itself.
}
{darken
The color will be darkened.
}
{updatepixels
The color of the current Pixel is updated.
