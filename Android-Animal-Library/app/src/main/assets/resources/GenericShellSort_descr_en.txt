Insertion Sort is slow, because it can only move elements
one position to the right with each step.
Shellsort tries to move elements faster to their final position
by using leaps.

The data is h-sorted in each step. A set of data is
h-sorted, if selecting every h-th element starting at position 0,..., h-1
will always yield a sorted data set.

Therefore, a h-sorted array consists of h independently sorted
data sets interleaved in one array.

To sort the data, Shell Sort performs a set of h-sorting steps
for decreasing values of h, until it finally performs h-sorting for h==1.
h==1 essentially equals Insertion Sort.
The set of values to use for h is also called the increment order.

Verbal Description:

It can be proved, that h[i+1]=3*h[i]+1 yields good results.
Using this, the algorithm can be adapted as follows:

1. while h<=n/9, set h=3*h+1
2. Set i=h
3. Store Element a[i] in a variable v, and store i in j
4. While j>h ist and a[j-h]>v, set a[j]=a[j-h] and j=j-h
5. Set a[j]=v
6. Increment i. If i<n, continue with step 3
7. Set h=h/3 (integer division!). If h>0, continue with step 2
