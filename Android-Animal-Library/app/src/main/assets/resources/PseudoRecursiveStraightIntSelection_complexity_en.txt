Some comments about complexity

Straight Selection is always linear (and is therefore also
called 'Linear Search'). If it is safe to assume that the
data is sorted, there are far better searching algorithms,
such as binary or interpolative searching.

If the data is unsorted, there may not be a better algorithm
than Straight Selection - also depending on the type and
source of the data. For example, data coming from a network
connection has to be read in sequentially, usually without
being easily able to jump forward or backward. Simply comparing
the data with the target value as each piece of data is being
read is both obvious and has a good performance.
