algoDesc=This generator will sort the array entered by the user using Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they are not in ascending order. This step is repeated until no further swaps are performed. This usually requires multiple loop iterations.\nDepending on the sorting order (de- or ascending), the smallest or largest values rise to the top (end of the array), much as air bubbles in water do - hence the name.
