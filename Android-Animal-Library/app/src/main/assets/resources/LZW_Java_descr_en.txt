The Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm is a lossless compression algorithm.
It uses a dictionary to replace character sequences that occur multiple times
in the text by a key. For the textual input demonstrated here, each character is
represented by its ASCII value.

One strength of the LZW algorithm is that no dictionary has to be transmitted,
as the dictionary can be created at run-time both during the compression and the
decompression phase. A given input sequence will be added to the dictionary if it
is not contained in the dictionary, but its prefix already is in the dictionary.
