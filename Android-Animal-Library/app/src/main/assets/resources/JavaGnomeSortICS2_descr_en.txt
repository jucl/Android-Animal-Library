Gnome sort puts items in order by comparing two neighbouring items.
The basic idea is to start from the beginning of the array and
to move to the next item until we find two items that are not in order.
In that case we swap them and move to the previous item. That way
the swapping gets propagated backwards until the item finds it's proper
place.
