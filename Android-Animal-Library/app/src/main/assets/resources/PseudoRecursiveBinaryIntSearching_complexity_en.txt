Some comments about complexity

Binary Search has a (binary) logarithmic complexity. 
Finding a given element in a set of 1024 elements will 
therefore take at most 10 iterations. This can be explained
by the fact that each iteration will halve the number of
regarded elements in the array.

It is important to remember that Binary Search will
only work for sorted data. If the data is not fully sorted,
getting the right result depends more on luck than on the
algorithm.
