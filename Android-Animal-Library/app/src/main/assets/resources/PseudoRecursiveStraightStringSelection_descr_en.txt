Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for locating a given
element in an array of sorted elements.

Binary Search always regards only a certain partition of the array.
The first partition covers the complete array. The partition is
halved in each recursive step by adapting the partition borders.
If the value is found, its position is returned; otherwise, 
the algorithm with return -1 as an 'error mark'.

In the following animation, the current partition will be highlighted.
