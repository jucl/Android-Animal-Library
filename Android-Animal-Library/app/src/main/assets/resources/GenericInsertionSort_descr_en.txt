Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm, a comparison sort 
in which the sorted array (or list) is built one entry at a time.

The process is similar to sorting a deck of cards: in each step a
new card will be inserted in the already sorted ones.

Verbal description of Insertion Sort:

1. Set i = 1
2. Save a[i] in variable v and set j = i
3. While j>0 and v is smaller than a[j-1], copy
  a[j-1] at position a[j] and set j = j - 1
4. Insert element v at position j
5. If i is smaller than n, increment i with one and continue
  with step 2
