Straight Selection is probably the most obvious searching algorithm.

The recursive implementation will first check if the array is null
or if the end of the array has already been reached. If so, the
value is not found and -1 is returned.
Otherwise, the current element is compared with the search value.
If they match, the current position is returned. Otherwise, the
method is invoked recursively for the next array position.
