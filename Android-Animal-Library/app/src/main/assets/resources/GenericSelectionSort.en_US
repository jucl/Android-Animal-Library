algoDesc=This algorithm performs Selection Sort.<br />First, the smallest value in the array is exchanged with the value at the first array position. Thus, we have a partially sorted array at position [0, 0] and an unsorted array starting at position i=1.<br />Next, we continue the process for i=1, exchanging the smallest value in the array from position i to the end of the array with the element at position i. This is continued until i reaches the last element, at which time the array is sorted.
