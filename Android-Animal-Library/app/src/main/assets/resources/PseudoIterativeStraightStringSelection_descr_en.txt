Straight Selection is probably the most obvious searching algorithm

Starting with the first element, each element is compared sequentially
with the value to be searched for. If the current element matches the
value to look for, the current position is returned as a result.
Otherwise, searching continues with the next element.

If the element searched for is not found, the algorithm with return
-1 as an 'error mark' once all elements where examined.
