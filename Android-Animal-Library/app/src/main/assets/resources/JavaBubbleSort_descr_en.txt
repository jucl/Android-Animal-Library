Bubble Sort is an elementary sorting algorithm taught in many
introductory computer science course at schools and universities.

The basic idea of Bubble Sort is swapping neighbouring elements
so that they will then be in ascending order.

A verbal description of Bubble Sort is as follows:

1. Set i = n
2. Set j = 1 and set a boolean variable swapPerformed to false
3. In a loop, swap all neighbouring elements a[j-1] and a[j],
  if a[j-1] > a[j]. If a swap was done, set swapPerformed to true
4. Increment j until j == i
5. Decrement i until i == -1 or swapPerformed == false,
  and continue with step 2.
